## 🎯 Quick Action Plan

1. ✅ **Get EC2 IP** - COMPLETED
   - EC2 Elastic IP: `51.21.235.209`

2. ✅ **Update README** - COMPLETED
   - Replaced all `<ADD_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DOMAIN>` with `51.21.235.209`
   - Screenshots section uncommented and displayed

3. 🔲 **Create Architecture Diagram** (30 minutes) - REMAINING
   - Use draw.io or Lucidchart
   - Follow the flow described in README Architecture section
   - Save as `docs/architecture.png`

4. ✅ **Capture Screenshots** - COMPLETED
   - All 8 screenshots added to `docs/screenshots/`
   - Verified they display correctly in README

5. 🔲 **Final Review** (10 minutes) - REMAINING

## 📝 Notes

- The README is already comprehensive and meets all assignment requirements
- Main missing items are visual deliverables (diagram + screenshots)
- Once you add the EC2 IP and screenshots, the project is 100% complete
- Consider adding the old README content about app features if needed
